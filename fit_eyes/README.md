# Fit Eyes

experimental program that only calculates the relative position of eyes within the eye region

Eye region of the face and specifically eyes must be marked manually in a reference picture. It is then automatically tracked throughout a video sequence or a live stream. Upon calibration, the program draws the estimated eye movement as a line.
